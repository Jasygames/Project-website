                <p>Hi all. I'm not one for introductions but I'm Jasmine. Can either call me 
                     Jasy as I'm usually known online. A little bit about me, I'm a <strong>huge</strong> 
                     nerd, I'm very much into gaming,anime and painting as well as a growing interest
                     in technology. Some favouriote games currently are Destiny 2, Final Fantasy 14 and 
                     Resident evil 4. I've shared some images below of some warhammer models I have also 
                     collected and painted as some non technology achivements.
